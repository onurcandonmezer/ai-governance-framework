description: >
  A text classification model designed for categorizing customer support
  tickets into predefined categories for routing and prioritization.

intended_uses:
  - "Automatic categorization of customer support tickets"
  - "Priority assignment for incoming requests"
  - "Routing tickets to appropriate department"

out_of_scope_uses:
  - "Making final decisions without human review"
  - "Processing non-English text"
  - "Sentiment analysis or emotion detection"

target_users:
  - "Customer support team leads"
  - "IT operations team"

training_data_description: >
  Trained on 50,000 anonymized customer support tickets collected
  between 2022-2023. Data was reviewed for PII and de-identified.

limitations:
  - "Performance degrades on tickets mixing multiple categories"
  - "Not validated for languages other than English"
  - "May underperform on newly emerging issue categories"

bias_considerations:
  - "Tested for consistent performance across customer segments"
  - "No significant performance disparities identified across geographic regions"
  - "Ongoing monitoring for category-level bias"

risk_mitigations:
  - "Human review required for low-confidence predictions (< 0.7)"
  - "Monthly performance audits with updated test sets"
  - "Feedback loop for misclassified tickets"
